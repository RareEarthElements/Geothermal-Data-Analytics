Portfolio Data Analytics

A company engaged in renewable energy with a focus on geothermal exploration and development desired to conduct data analysis to assist in geothermal resource assessment. The company wants to assess and analyze geothermal resources in various locations that signify geothermal potential that has prospects for further development. The problem raised is to find out where the geothermal area is prospective for further exploration in order to provide long-term economic benefits for the company. Based on these problems, the company wants to know what factors/variables make a geothermal prospect area worthy of further exploration, so that they can make a better plan in assessing geothermal resources. Therefore, what we will do here is to analyze the data to find geothermal prospect areas based on the geothermal operation dataset.

Based on the geothermal prospect data analysis, we have identified two promising sites named VYSHKOVO and NEFTEKU5. These sites exhibit thermal conductivity values above 6 W/mK, indicating potential geothermal activity. Additionally, they have heat flow levels of 79 mW/m^2 and temperature gradients within the range of 43 - 46 mK/m, further supporting their geothermal prospects. Site NEFTEKU5 is associated with the Mesozoic Orogeny, while VYSHKOVO is linked to tertiary orogenic or volcanic zones. This geological information is essential in understanding the underlying geological conditions that may influence geothermal activities.

Considering the geological affinity of NEFTEKU5 with the Mesozoic Orogeny, it is recommended to prioritize further research and exploration efforts in locations linked to similar geological events. By focusing on these areas, we can gain valuable insights into the geological processes that contribute to geothermal potential. Moreover, leveraging machine learning regression models to predict heat flow values from various geological and physical features can enhance our understanding and facilitate more efficient site selection for geothermal energy development. This integrated approach will enable us to make informed decisions and maximize the exploration success in harnessing geothermal energy for sustainable and environmentally-friendly energy production.
